STP is built with [CMake](http://cmake.org/), version 2.6 or newer.

CMake is a meta build system that generates build files for other tools such as
make(1), Visual Studio, Xcode, etc. For a list of generators supported on your
platform, consult `cmake --help`.


# Example with make(1)

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -G 'Unix Makefiles' ..
    make

In subsequent builds, only the `make` command is required.
